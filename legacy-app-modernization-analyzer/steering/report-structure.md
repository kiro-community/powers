# Modernization Report Structure

This defines the standard report structure for ALL modernization analyses (.NET, WebLogic, WebSphere).

## CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

**This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for report formatting. Follow these rules exactly:**

1. **NO dollar amounts by default** - Use qualitative levels (Low/Medium/High/Very High) for cost estimates
2. **NO time estimates** - No hours, days, weeks, or months anywhere in the report
3. **NO real dates** - Gantt charts use generic weeks (Week 1, Week 2, etc.)
4. **NO file counts or line counts** - Solution Structure is simple
5. **NO Appendix section** - Report ends with Conclusion
6. **Professional Advisory Notice goes at TOP** - Before Executive Summary, not at the end
7. **Cost-Benefit Analysis compares PATHWAYS** - Current vs Pathway 1 vs Pathway 2 vs Pathway 3 (NOT by component like Database/Compute/Storage)
8. **Legends REQUIRED** - Every architecture diagram must have a color legend after it
9. **Gantt chart for 3-Year costs** - Use Mermaid Gantt as stacked horizontal bars (NOT line chart, NOT pie chart)
10. **NO "Quick Wins" section** - Implementation timeline is based on recommended pathway phases only
11. **Pathway Theme required** - Each pathway needs a 3-5 sentence theme paragraph
12. **Pros and Cons required** - Each pathway needs a pros/cons table
13. **Parallel tasks in Gantt** - Show concurrent tasks and dependencies clearly
14. **ABSOLUTELY NO ASCII ART** - ALL diagrams MUST use Mermaid.js syntax ONLY
15. **Visual dot indicators for scoring** - Use ●●●●●●●●●○ (9) format in Pathway Scoring Matrix
16. **OPTIONAL detailed pricing** - User can request 1,000 vCPU assumption with real AWS HK region pricing (see Section 9 Appendix)

---

## VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS - MERMAID ONLY

**⛔ ASCII ART IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN ⛔**

ALL diagrams in this report MUST be Mermaid.js diagrams. ASCII art diagrams are NOT ACCEPTABLE and will cause the report to FAIL quality checks.

### FORBIDDEN - DO NOT USE:
```
❌ ASCII art boxes:
+------------------+
|   Component      |
+------------------+
        |
        v
+------------------+
|   Another        |
+------------------+

❌ ASCII arrows: -->, ===>, |---> 
❌ ASCII boxes: [____], +----+, |    |
❌ Text-based flow diagrams
❌ Any diagram made with +, -, |, or > characters
```

### REQUIRED - USE ONLY MERMAID:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Component] --> B[Another]
```

**RULE: If you find yourself typing `+`, `-`, `|`, or `>` characters to draw boxes or arrows, STOP IMMEDIATELY and use Mermaid.js instead.**

---

## Report Sections

### 1. Professional Advisory Notice (TOP OF REPORT)

MUST include this EXACT notice at the VERY TOP of the report, before Executive Summary:

> 📋 **Professional Advisory Notice**: This report provides a high-level technical analysis based on automated codebase scanning and should be interpreted in consultation with AWS Modernization Specialists or authorized AWS Modernization Partners. The findings and recommendations herein are intended to inform strategic planning discussions and should not be acted upon directly without professional guidance. Implementation effectiveness is influenced by numerous factors that cannot be extracted from the codebase alone, including organizational readiness, team dynamics, business constraints, regulatory requirements, and market conditions. We recommend engaging with qualified modernization experts to develop a comprehensive implementation strategy tailored to your specific organizational context.

### 7. Recommended Pathways

Generate exactly 3 distinct pathways.

#### Pathway Recommendation Scoring Framework

Each pathway is evaluated using a weighted scoring system across 6 key factors. The **Recommendation Score** is a weighted average that balances all factors for decision-making.

**Scoring Factors & Weights:**

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Long-term Value | 25% | Cost savings, performance gains, future-proofing potential |
| Implementation Risk | 20% | Technical complexity, failure probability, rollback difficulty |
| Cost Efficiency | 20% | Infrastructure savings, licensing elimination, operational overhead reduction |
| Time to Value | 15% | How quickly benefits are realized after migration |
| Team Readiness | 10% | Skills availability, training requirements, learning curve |
| Business Continuity | 10% | Disruption to operations during migration, parallel running capability |

**Pathway Scoring Matrix:**

Use visual dot indicators to show scores. Format: `●●●●●●●●●○ (9)` where filled dots = score, empty dots = remaining to 10.

| Factor (Weight) | Pathway 1: Full Modernization | Pathway 2: Lift & Optimize | Pathway 3: Containerize Only |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Long-term Value (25%) | ●●●●●●●●●○ (9) | ●●●●●●○○○○ (6) | ●●●○○○○○○○ (3) |
| Implementation Risk (20%) | ●●●●●●○○○○ (6) | ●●●●●●●○○○ (7) | ●●●●●●●●●○ (9) |
| Cost Efficiency (20%) | ●●●●●●●●●○ (9) | ●●●●●○○○○○ (5) | ●●●○○○○○○○ (3) |
| Time to Value (15%) | ●●●●●○○○○○ (5) | ●●●●●●●○○○ (7) | ●●●●●●●●●○ (9) |
| Team Readiness (10%) | ●●●●●●○○○○ (6) | ●●●●●●●○○○ (7) | ●●●●●●●●●○ (9) |
| Business Continuity (10%) | ●●●●●●●○○○ (7) | ●●●●●●●●○○ (8) | ●●●●●●●●●○ (9) |
| **Recommendation Score** | **7.4/10** | **6.4/10** | **5.4/10** |

> 📋 **Scoring Note**: Higher scores are better for all factors. Implementation Risk is scored inversely (10 = lowest risk, 1 = highest risk). The Recommendation Score is calculated as the weighted average of all factors. Pathway 1 excels in long-term value and cost efficiency but requires more effort. Pathway 3 scores high on ease factors but low on value factors.

**Pathway Comparison Matrix** (Mermaid quadrantChart):
```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Modernization Pathway Comparison
    x-axis Low Effort --> High Effort
    y-axis Low Value --> High Value
    quadrant-1 Strategic Wins
    quadrant-2 Quick Wins
    quadrant-3 Low Priority
    quadrant-4 Major Projects
    "Pathway 1: Name": [x, y]
    "Pathway 2: Name": [x, y]
    "Pathway 3: Name": [x, y]
```

---

For each pathway:

**Pathway N: [Name] (Recommendation Score: X.X/10)** - ✅ RECOMMENDED / ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED

- **7 Rs Classification:** Classification (with brief description)
- **Gartner TIME:** Classification

**Pathway Theme:**
A paragraph (3-5 sentences) describing the overall philosophy and approach of this pathway. Explain what makes this pathway unique, who it's best suited for, and the key trade-offs involved. This should help stakeholders quickly understand the essence of the pathway without reading all the details.

**Strategy Overview:**
Brief description of the approach.

**Migration Roadmap** (Mermaid flowchart with phases):
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Phase1["Phase 1: Name"]
        A1[Task 1]
        A2[Task 2]
    end
    
    subgraph Phase2["Phase 2: Name"]
        B1[Task 1]
    end
    
    Phase1 --> Phase2
    
    style Phase1 fill:#color
    style Phase2 fill:#color
```

**Effort Breakdown** (NO time estimates, use relative sequencing):
| Phase | Complexity | Relative Sequence | Key Deliverables |
|-------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Phase 1: Name | Low/Medium/High | First | Deliverables |
| Phase 2: Name | Low/Medium/High | Second | Deliverables |

**Pros and Cons:**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| ✅ Benefit 1 | ❌ Drawback 1 |
| ✅ Benefit 2 | ❌ Drawback 2 |

### 8. Next Steps: Recommended Pathway Implementation

This section details the implementation plan for the **recommended pathway** identified in Section 7. Do NOT include a separate "Quick Wins" section - all implementation details should be based on the recommended pathway phases.

#### Implementation Roadmap

> ⚠️ **Timeline Disclaimer**: The timeline shown in this roadmap is for **indicative conceptual visualization only** and does not represent a precise estimation. Actual timelines can vary significantly based on factors including modernization team experience, project priorities, resource allocation, organizational change management processes, testing requirements, and third-party dependencies.

Use generic week numbers (Week 1, Week 2, etc.) - NO real dates. The Gantt chart MUST show:
- Tasks from the recommended pathway phases
- Parallel execution where tasks can run concurrently
- Dependencies between tasks (stacked/sequential where required)
- Clear visualization of which tasks block others

**CRITICAL: Use explicit start/end positions, NOT `after` syntax.** The `after` keyword does not render correctly with `dateFormat X`. Always use `:taskId, startWeek, endWeek` format.

```mermaid
gantt
    title Recommended Pathway Implementation (Indicative Timeline)
    dateFormat X
    axisFormat Week %s
    
    section Phase 1: [Name]
    Task 1 (Foundation)           :a1, 0, 2
    Task 2 (Can run parallel)     :a2, 0, 2
    Task 3 (Depends on Task 1)    :a3, 2, 3
    
    section Phase 2: [Name]
    Task 4 (Depends on Phase 1)   :b1, 3, 6
    Task 5 (Parallel with Task 4) :b2, 3, 5
    Task 6 (Depends on Task 4)    :b3, 6, 8
    
    section Phase 3: [Name]
    Task 7 (Depends on Phase 2)   :c1, 8, 10
    Task 8 (Parallel with Task 7) :c2, 8, 11
```

**Gantt Chart Syntax Rules:**
- Format: `:taskId, startWeek, endWeek` (e.g., `:a1, 0, 2` means Week 0 to Week 2)
- Parallel tasks: Same start week (e.g., `:a1, 0, 2` and `:a2, 0, 2`)
- Sequential tasks: Next task starts where previous ends (e.g., `:a3, 2, 3` follows `:a1, 0, 2`)
- **DO NOT use `after` keyword** - it doesn't render correctly with numeric date format

**Key:** Tasks with the same start week run in parallel. Sequential dependencies are shown by starting a task at the end week of its predecessor.

#### Phase Breakdown

Detail each phase from the recommended pathway:

| Phase | Key Activities | Complexity | Dependencies | Key Deliverables |
|-------|---------------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Phase 1: [Name] | Activity list | Low/Medium/High | Prerequisites | Deliverables |
| Phase 2: [Name] | Activity list | Low/Medium/High | Phase 1 completion | Deliverables |
| Phase 3: [Name] | Activity list | Low/Medium/High | Phase 2 completion | Deliverables |

NO effort estimates in hours/days/weeks.

#### Immediate Actions

| Action | Owner | Complexity | Impact |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| Action description | Team/Role | Low/Medium/High | Impact description |

#### Decision Points & Dependencies

Mermaid flowchart showing decision flow and dependencies for the recommended pathway.

#### Recommended Tool Support

Prioritize AWS Transform tools in this order:

| Tool | Purpose | Phase |
|------|---------|-------|
| AWS Transform for Windows Full Stack | End-to-end .NET modernization (framework upgrade + database migration) | All phases |
| AWS Transform for .NET | .NET Framework to .NET Core/8 porting, EF6 → EF Core migration | Phase 1-2 |
| AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) | Database schema conversion analysis | Phase 2 |
| AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) | Data migration with minimal downtime | Phase 3-4 |
| AWS App2Container | Containerization of existing applications | Phase 4 |
| Kiro | AI-assisted code migration and refactoring | All phases |

Note: For .NET modernization, prefer AWS Transform for Windows Full Stack when both application and database migration are needed. Use individual tools (SCT, DMS, App2Container) only for specific scenarios or when Transform doesn't cover the use case.

### 9. Cost-Benefit Analysis

**CRITICAL: This section compares costs BY PATHWAY (Current vs Pathway 1 vs Pathway 2 vs Pathway 3), NOT by component (Database/Compute/Storage). Do NOT create charts showing cost by component.**

#### 3-Year Cost Comparison (Qualitative)

Use qualitative levels (Low/Medium/High/Very High) - NO dollar amounts by default:

| Cost Factor | Current | Pathway 1 | Pathway 2 | Pathway 3 |
|-------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Compute | Baseline | Low | Medium | High |
| Database | Baseline | Low | High | High |
| Licensing | High | None | Medium | High |
| Migration Effort | N/A | High | Medium | Low |
| Operational Overhead | High | Low | Medium | High |
| **Overall Recurring** | Baseline | **60-70% savings** | **30-40% savings** | **~0% savings** |

#### 3-Year Cost Visualization

Use a Mermaid Gantt chart to create stacked horizontal bars showing relative year-by-year costs:

```mermaid
gantt
    title 3-Year Relative Cost Comparison (Baseline = 100)
    dateFormat X
    axisFormat %s
    todayMarker off

    section Current (300)
    Year 1 - 100    :active, 0, 100
    Year 2 - 100    :crit, 100, 200
    Year 3 - 100    :200, 300

    section Pathway 1 (~100)
    Year 1 - 45     :active, 0, 45
    Year 2 - 25     :crit, 45, 70
    Year 3 - 25     :70, 95

    section Pathway 2 (~180)
    Year 1 - 70     :active, 0, 70
    Year 2 - 55     :crit, 70, 125
    Year 3 - 55     :125, 180

    section Pathway 3 (~305)
    Year 1 - 105    :active, 0, 105
    Year 2 - 100    :crit, 105, 205
    Year 3 - 100    :205, 305
```

**Legend:** 🔵 Year 1 (active = blue) | 🔴 Year 2 (crit = red) | 🩵 Year 3 (no status = teal/cyan) — X-axis: Relative cost units (Current annual = 100). Bar length represents cumulative 3-year cost.

**Gantt Chart Color Reference:**
- `active` = blue
- `crit` = red
- (no status) = teal/cyan

#### Key Cost Drivers

| Driver | Impact | Pathway 1 | Pathway 2 | Pathway 3 |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Database Licensing | Very High | ✅ Eliminated | ❌ Retained | ❌ Retained |
| OS Licensing | High | ✅ Eliminated | ✅ Eliminated | ❌ Retained |
| Graviton ARM64 | Medium | ✅ 20% savings | ❌ Not available | ❌ Not available |
| Serverless DB | Medium | ✅ Auto-scaling | ❌ Not used | ❌ Not used |

#### ROI Summary

| Metric | Pathway 1 | Pathway 2 | Pathway 3 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Investment Level | High | Medium | Low |
| Returns Potential | Very High | Medium | None |
| Payback Period | Short-term (months) | Short-term (months) | N/A |
| Risk-Adjusted Value | High | Medium | Low |

**Key Value Drivers:**
- Pathway 1: Maximum savings from eliminating all licensing costs + Graviton compute
- Pathway 2: Moderate savings from OS license elimination only
- Pathway 3: No recurring savings; only operational benefits

#### Cost Optimization Opportunities

| Optimization | Potential Additional Savings |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Compute Savings Plans (1-year) | Up to 17% |
| Compute Savings Plans (3-year) | Up to 52% |
| Reserved Capacity | Up to 35% on databases |
| Spot Instances | Up to 70% on eligible tasks |
| Right-sizing | 10-30% typical |

---

### OPTIONAL: Detailed Cost Simulation (1,000 vCPU Assumption)

> 📋 **User Request Required**: This section is ONLY included if the user explicitly requests detailed cost calculations. Ask: *"Would you like me to include a detailed cost simulation based on 1,000 vCPUs with real AWS Hong Kong region pricing?"*

If requested, include the following detailed analysis:

#### Baseline Assumption

> 📋 **Baseline Assumption**: This analysis assumes a production workload of **1,000 vCPUs** running continuously (24/7/365) in **Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)** region. All prices are based on on-demand pricing as of January 2025. Actual costs may vary based on Reserved Instance commitments, Savings Plans, and usage patterns.

#### Pricing Reference Sources

| Service | Pricing Source |
|---------|---------------|
| ECS Fargate | [AWS Fargate Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/pricing/) |
| RDS SQL Server | [AWS RDS SQL Server Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/pricing/) |
| Aurora PostgreSQL | [AWS Aurora Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/pricing/) |

#### Compute Pricing Breakdown (per vCPU-hour, HK Region)

| Platform | vCPU/hour | Memory/GB/hour | OS License/vCPU/hour | Total/vCPU/hour (with 2GB RAM) |
|----------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Fargate Linux/x86 | $0.0XXX | $0.00XXX | — | **$0.0XXX** |
| Fargate Linux/ARM (Graviton) | $0.0XXX | $0.00XXX | — | **$0.0XXX** |
| Fargate Windows/x86 | $0.0XXX | $0.0XXX | $0.0XX | **$0.1XXX** |

#### Database Pricing Breakdown (HK Region)

| Database | Instance/Capacity | Hourly Cost | Monthly Cost (730 hrs) | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| RDS SQL Server Standard (Multi-AZ) | db.m5.2xlarge | ~$X.XX/hr | ~$X,XXX | License included |
| Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 | Per ACU | $0.XX/ACU-hour | $XX.XX/ACU | 1 ACU ≈ 2GB RAM |

> 📋 **Database Sizing Rationale**: For a typical web application, database compute is commonly 5-10% of application tier capacity. For 1,000 app vCPUs, 2 × db.m5.2xlarge (16 vCPU total) or 16 ACU Aurora is reasonable.
